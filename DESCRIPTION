Description: A rather simple implementation of J. H. Holland's "Learning Classifier System".
    This is a Michigan style LCS.
    An LCS is "natively" interpretable ML algorithm in that it generates rules as its output model(s).
    Said rules can be "read".
    This implementation accepts only binary strings as "state" for input, and any set of classes.
    It is also a somewhat slow algorithm to be trained.
    However, said drawbacks are compensated by an interpretable output, and given enough time (depending on training data), it can be used to do Supervised Learning.
    The same package can be used to do data mining, as some examples (included) demonstrate.
    Moreover, although not included in the published v0.1.0, the RLCS package allows for Reinforcement Learning scenarios as well.
    Future versions will provide tests and also include more examples & datasets (e.g. images classifier scheduled for v0.2.0).
