# Versions History

## Upcoming work

Text encoding for binary input compatible with RLCS for NLP tasks is currently being
studied and is potentially interesting.

## v0.1.3

Version v0.1.3 now adds natively the option to do horizontal splits of the datasets to train sub-LCS agents. A cleaner use of matrices without
parent env overwrites and a corresponding change in RLCS class was added.
RL scenario being re-worked, stable but can be made faster.

## v0.1.2

Version v0.1.2 added support for (where available) foreach/doParallel, using validation sets to compare several agents trained in parallel, and more demos. It also
includes a much (much) faster matching step, which has a true positive impact on speed. The RLCS "rosetta stone" functionality also
makes it much easier to leverage RLCS on numerical data.

## v0.1.1

Essentially included more demos.

## v0.1.0

I guess it was the first "stable" version.
